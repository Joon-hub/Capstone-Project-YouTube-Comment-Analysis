Capstone Project: YouTube Comment Analysis

**Description**

This capstone project aims to analyze YouTube comments to gain meaningful insights using advanced data science and machine learning techniques. The primary objectives include sentiment analysis to classify comments as positive, negative, or neutral, keyword extraction to identify frequently discussed topics, and trend identification to uncover patterns in user engagement and content discussions.

The project demonstrates the practical implementation of a data pipeline, starting from data collection through the YouTube Data API, to pre-processing, analysis, and visualization of the results. By leveraging Python and its rich ecosystem of libraries, the project delivers actionable insights that can benefit content creators, marketers, and researchers alike.

Key components of the repository include:

- **Data Collection**: Scripts to fetch comments from YouTube videos using the YouTube Data API.

- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, removing noise, and preparing data for analysis.

- **Sentiment** Analysis: Utilizing natural language processing techniques to categorize comments.

- **Keyword** and Trend Analysis: Extracting frequently mentioned words and identifying trending themes.

- **Visualization**: Generating charts and graphs to represent data insights effectively.

The repository is structured to be modular and easy to understand, enabling users to extend the project for additional analysis or integrate it with other data sources. This project serves as a comprehensive guide and resource for anyone interested in exploring text data analysis using YouTube comments.
